Protocols need to implement the type-specific encoding they need in order to\n * produce the hash of their typed data using a combination of `abi.encode` and `keccak256`.\n *\n * This contract implements the EIP 712 domain separator ({_domainSeparatorV4}) that is used as part of the encoding\n * scheme, and the final step of the encoding to obtain the message digest that is then signed via ECDSA\n * ({_hashTypedDataV4}).\n *\n * The implementation of the domain separator was designed to be as efficient as possible while still properly updating\n * the chain id to protect against replay attacks on an eventual fork of the chain.\n *\n * NOTE: This contract implements the version of the encoding known as \"v4\", as implemented by the JSON RPC method\n * https://docs.metamask.io/guide/signing-data.html[`eth_signTypedDataV4` in MetaMask].\n *\n * NOTE: In the upgradeable version of this contract, the cached values will correspond to the address, and the domain\n * separator of the implementation contract. This will cause the {_domainSeparatorV4} function to always rebuild the\n * separator from the immutable values, which is cheaper than accessing a cached version in cold storage.\n */\nabstract contract EIP712Upgradeable is Initializable, IERC5267 {\n    bytes32 private constant TYPE_HASH =\n        keccak256(\"EIP712Domain(string name,string version,uint256 chainId,address verifyingContract)\");\n\n    /// @custom:storage-location erc7201:openzeppelin.storage.EIP712\n    struct EIP712Storage {\n        /// @custom:oz-renamed-from _HASHED_NAME\n        bytes32 _hashedName;\n        /// @custom:oz-renamed-from _HASHED_VERSION\n        bytes32 _hashedVersion;\n\n        string _name;\n        string _version;\n    }\n\n    // keccak256(abi.encode(uint256(keccak256(\"openzeppelin.storage.EIP712\")) - 1)) & ~bytes32(uint256(0xff))\n    bytes32 private constant EIP712StorageLocation = 0xa16a46d94261c7517cc8ff89f61c0ce93598e3c849801011dee649a6a557d100;\n\n    function _getEIP712Storage() private pure returns (EIP712Storage storage $) {\n        assembly {\n            $.slot := EIP712StorageLocation\n        }\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Initializes the domain separator and parameter caches.\n     *\n     * The meaning of `name` and `version` is specified in\n     * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712#definition-of-domainseparator[EIP 712]:\n     *\n     * - `name`: the user readable name of the signing domain, i.e. the name of the DApp or the protocol.\n     * - `version`: the current major version of the signing domain.\n     *\n     * NOTE: These parameters cannot be changed except through a xref:learn::upgrading-smart-contracts.adoc[smart\n     * contract upgrade].\n     */\n    function __EIP712_init(string memory name, string memory version) internal onlyInitializing {\n        __EIP712_init_unchained(name, version);\n    }\n\n    function __EIP712_init_unchained(string memory name, string memory version) internal onlyInitializing {\n        EIP712Storage storage $ = _getEIP712Storage();\n        $._name = name;\n        $._version = version;\n\n        // Reset prior values in storage if upgrading\n        $._hashedName = 0;\n        $._hashedVersion = 0;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Returns the domain separator for the current chain.\n     */\n    function _domainSeparatorV4() internal view returns (bytes32) {\n        return _buildDomainSeparator();\n    }\n\n    function _buildDomainSeparator() private view returns (bytes32) {\n        return keccak256(abi.encode(TYPE_HASH, _EIP712NameHash(), _EIP712VersionHash(), block.chainid, address(this)));\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Given an already https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712#definition-of-hashstruct[hashed struct], this\n     * function returns the hash of the fully encoded EIP712 message for this domain.\n     *\n     * This hash can be used together with {ECDSA-recover} to obtain the signer of a message.

By not relying on {IERC20-approve}, the token holder account doesn't\n * need to send a transaction, and thus is not required to hold Ether at all.\n *\n * ==== Security Considerations\n *\n * There are two important considerations concerning the use of `permit`. The first is that a valid permit signature\n * expresses an allowance, and it should not be assumed to convey additional meaning. In particular, it should not be\n * considered as an intention to spend the allowance in any specific way. The second is that because permits have\n * built-in replay protection and can be submitted by anyone, they can be frontrun. A protocol that uses permits should\n * take this into consideration and allow a `permit` call to fail. Combining these two aspects, a pattern that may be\n * generally recommended is:\n *\n * ```solidity\n * function doThingWithPermit(..., uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {\n *     try token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s) {} catch {}\n *     doThing(..., value);\n * }\n *\n * function doThing(..., uint256 value) public {\n *     token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), value);\n *     ...\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Observe that: 1) `msg.sender` is used as the owner, leaving no ambiguity as to the signer intent, and 2) the use of\n * `try/catch` allows the permit to fail and makes the code tolerant to frontrunning. (See also\n * {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).\n *\n * Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so\n * contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.\n */\ninterface IERC20Permit {\n    /**\n     * @dev Sets `value` as the allowance of `spender` over ``owner``'s tokens,\n     * given ``owner``'s signed approval.\n     *\n     * IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction\n     * ordering also apply here.\n     *\n     * Emits an {Approval} event.\n     *\n     * Requirements:\n     *\n     * - `spender` cannot be the zero address.\n     * - `deadline` must be a timestamp in the future.\n     * - `v`, `r` and `s` must be a valid `secp256k1` signature from `owner`\n     * over the EIP712-formatted function arguments.\n     * - the signature must use ``owner``'s current nonce (see {nonces}).\n     *\n     * For more information on the signature format, see the\n     * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification[relevant EIP\n     * section].\n     *\n     * CAUTION: See Security Considerations above.\n     */\n    function permit(\n        address owner,\n        address spender,\n        uint256 value,\n        uint256 deadline,\n        uint8 v,\n        bytes32 r,\n        bytes32 s\n    ) external;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Returns the current nonce for `owner`.
